# Sign In & Sign Up Page Documentation 

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the HTML and CSS code for a Sign In & Sign Up web page. The page is designed to allow users to sign in or sign up for an account with a clean and modern user interface.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure consists of the following elements:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Document type declaration for HTML5.
- `<html lang="en">`: HTML root element with the language attribute set to English.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata such as character set, viewport settings, page title, external stylesheet link, and Font Awesome script.
- `<body>`: Main content of the page.
   - `.container`: Main container for the entire page.
   - `.forms-container`: Container for the sign-in and sign-up forms.
      - `.signin-signup`: Container for both sign-in and sign-up forms.
         - `form.sign-in-form` and `form.sign-up-form`: Sign-in and sign-up forms, respectively.
         - Each form contains input fields for username, password (for sign-in), or email (for sign-up), along with social media login options.
   - `.panels-container`: Container for the left and right panels.
      - `.panel.left-panel`: Panel with content for new users.
      - `.panel.right-panel`: Panel with content for existing users.
- JavaScript file linked at the end of the body: `app.js`.

## CSS Styling

The CSS code is responsible for styling and responsiveness. Key components include:

- Styling for the overall layout and positioning of elements.
- Form styling with input fields, icons, and buttons.
- Animation effects for transitioning between sign-in and sign-up forms.
- Background gradient animation in `.container:before`.
- Media queries for responsive design adjustments based on screen width.

## External Resources

- Google Fonts: Poppins font is imported to style the text.
- Font Awesome: Icons are used for various elements, such as user icons, social media icons, etc.
- JavaScript: Linked script file (`app.js`) for handling dynamic interactions.

## Responsiveness

The design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. The layout adjusts for smaller screens, ensuring a good user experience on various devices.

## Usage

To use this code:

1. Ensure correct paths for external resources (Font Awesome, stylesheet).
2. Verify image paths for the `img` elements in the HTML.
3. Implement server-side logic for form submissions (not included in this code).

## Conclusion

This Sign In & Sign Up page provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for user authentication. Customizable features and functionalities can be added based on specific requirements.
